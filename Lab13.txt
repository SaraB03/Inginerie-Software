(a)

{{x==y}} z:=x−y {{z==0}}

Precondition: x==y

Command:  z:=x−y

Postcondition: z==0

Before executing the command, we have the precondition x==y.
The command z:=x−y sets z to the result of the expression x−y.
Given the precondition x==y, the expression x−y evaluates to 0.
Therefore, after the assignment, z will be 0.
This makes the postcondition z==0 true.
Hence, the triple {{x==y}} z:=x−y {{z==0}} holds.

(b)

{{true}} x:=100 {{x==100}}

Precondition: true

Command: x:=100

Postcondition: x==100

Explanation:

The precondition is true, which means it holds unconditionally (there are no specific requirements before executing the command).
The command x:=100 assigns the value 100 to x.
After the assignment, x will indeed be 100.
This makes the postcondition x==100 true.
Hence, the triple {{true}} x:=100 {{x==100}} holds.

(c)

{{0≤x<100}} x:=x+1 {{0≤x≤100}}

Precondition: 0≤x<100

Command: x:=x+1

Postcondition: 0≤x≤100

Explanation:

Before executing the command, we have the precondition 0≤x<100.
The command x:=x+1 increments x by 1.
Given the precondition, x is initially within the range [0,99].
After the increment, x will be within the range [1,100].
Therefore, after the assignment, x will satisfy the postcondition 0≤x≤100.
Hence, the triple {{0≤x<100}} x:=x+1 {{0≤x≤100}} holds.
